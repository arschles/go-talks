# Programming Pearls of Go

Go (Golang) is one of the fastest growing programming languages on the market. Originally conceived, designed and built by Google, the language was designed from the ground up to help build highly concurrent, scalable and distributed software. Singe its inception, the community around the language has grown quickly, from the compiler all the way up to the library ecosystem. After over two years building software with Go, I’ve seen patterns and anti-patterns emerge both in my code and the community. This talk will present a variety of those patterns distilled into their most useful, general form, the “pearl”. Along with each pearl, I’ll show real world examples on how to use the code as well. For this session, I’ll assume that you’ve at least written “hello world” in Go and have a beginner’s grasp on the language.
