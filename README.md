# This Repository is Deprecated

It used to have code samples that I referenced in talks I gave, but I moved everything to a new GitHub organization called [arschles/aarons-demo-code](https://github.com/aarons-demo-code). Each repository in there has code for a talk I gave.

**Please see https://github.com/aarons-demo-code**
