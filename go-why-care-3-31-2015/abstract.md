# Why you should pay attention to Go (golang)

Our world as software engineers is drastically different today than 2 years ago.
Not only does almost everything run in the cloud, but there is no more classic
2 or 3 tiered architecture for the web. Normal applications today run on
unreliable VMs, talk to multiple databases, queues, caches, APIs, and plenty more.
On top of that, we have N different clients all with different data and networking needs.

Amidst all the chaos, our software must stay available to many different clients.
Enter Go.

In this talk, I'll introduce Go and we'll discuss case studies that
illustrate hard problems in modern online software and how Go solves them better
than most languages available today. At the end of the talk, I'll present my
argument that Go will grow to be a dominant language for systems software
and web software alike.
